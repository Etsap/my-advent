Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems at https://adventofcode.com/

I had some fun re-working each of my solutions to be shorter code, which generally leads to less readability than my usual style.  For the most part, they solve the problems in less than 10 seconds, though for a few of the more complex problems, a few minutes may be necessary.

My inputs are also included, but the code should run for any user's input.
